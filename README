NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Log - Provide logging for
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable

VERSION
    Version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
    This module logs all traffic in irc channels to files. Every channel is
    logged to its own logfile and all files are rotated every 24 hours. For
    the sake of simplicity this module implements a very straightforward
    logging mechanism. Please take a look at the BUGS section for its
    limitations.

IRC USAGE
    None. If the module is loaded every message, join and part event is
    recorded in the channel's log file.

FUNCTIONS
  seen
    The bot calls this functions for every message sent to the channel. The
    message is then formatted and sent further to the loggings subsystem. If
    the message is from the bot or addressed to it and "ignore_bot" is set
    to a true value, those messages are not logged. The same applies if the
    body of the message matches the pattern defined in "ignore_pattern". The
    default logging output would look something like

    [#botzone 12:34:12] <me> Hello World

  emoted
    This function simply calls seen.

  chanjoin
    This function is called every time someone enters the channel. The event
    is logged as follows:

    [#botzone 12:34:12] JOIN: me

  chanpart
    This function is called every time someone leaves the channel. The event
    is logged as follows:

    [#botzone 12:34:12] PART: me

  replied
    When ignore_bot is set to false, we log replies of the bot in this
    function. The message is formatted as in seen.

  help
    Print a friendly help message to the channel.

  init
    Sets all user variables to their default values. Please see the next
    section for further information about their exact values.

VARIABLES
  ignore_pattern
    All lines mattching this regular expression will b<not> be logged at
    all. Normally all lines are logged.

  log_path
    Path to the directory where all logfiles are stored. Defaults to the
    current directory.

  timestamp_fmt
    Format of the timestamp that is prepended to every logged statement.
    Defaults to '%H:%M:%S'. Consult your system's strftime() manpage for
    details about these and the other arguments.

  ignore_bot
    Whether to ignore all communications with this bot. Defaults to 1.

  ignore_joinpart
    Whether to log join and part events. Defaults to 0.

  ignore_query
    Whether to ignore all communications in a query with this bot. Defaults
    to 1.

  link_current
    If this variable is true (default), we will generate a symbolic link to
    the current logfile called $channel_current.log.

BUGS
    *   For the sake of simplicity this module opens and closes the logfile
        every time a message is written. This is far from optimal, but save
        me the hassle to save open filehandles between invocations, locking
        over nfs and rotating the log files. In the future there will be a
        submodule to use Log::Log4perl or Log::Dispatch.

    *   No file is locked, so there could be a possible problem with
        multiple bots writing to the same file. This will also be solved by
        using one of the serious logging modules mentioned above.
